  ***I'm a trained biologist(masters)Upside-down face during one of my summer research internship, I was away from friends, loney& depressed, for time killing I got into social media with a fake alias and learnt about some cool hacking stuffs such as SQL injection, shelling etc.One day saw people Posting their achievements in bugbounty such as swags, hof, mugs ,sony t-shirts. Tried to contact some people, no one really helped and there was no such community support back then in 2017 I guess. I went back to normal College stuffs.Then when this covid kicked us out of college and sitting at home scrolling through Twitter I found my old followers list with security researchers. I found @aish_kendle doing this amazing challenge, and I looked at his progress and process and eventually jumped in.Having my knowledge in computational biology, I had some skills in bash and reading codes. I knew almost all the owasp top 10 and what it do. It was hard to pick one and learn. I found 
 @harshbothra_ talk's as a eye-opener and source of motivation.One thing I learnt in twitter is that, there is a button to know what others people liked.Just go and spy on the researcher you will get more amazing peoples, write-up, tools.
 Ifs someone post a bounty post, track down the company and hack, gey bounty.
 Small goal setting are good***


- What is your first reward in this journey and how much time it take you to find your first vulnerability.
 
   ***Accenture hof after 2 weeks of starting will be my favourite, learnt a lot in that rdp prgm! huge scope, subdomain enumeration, directory brute-forcing, screenshotting and more***

- How long have you been hunting? And how many programs do you focus on?
 
  ***I have focused more on public and private vdp prgms with large scope. I have tried with responsible disclosure, I haven't got many replies so just went with bugcowd. I have been hunting for last 3-4 months.***

- what are the vulnerabilities you hunt for everytime and you mastered ?

     ***I haven't mastered any vulanarabilty class to be honest, but most of the things I look for are in this amazing repo by 
 [@KathanP19](https://github.com/KathanP19/HowToHunt)
 I have got good at expanding my attack surface for now. Goal is to master a functionality abuse or bug type.***

- favorite recon tool ??
 
   ***Osmedues and nuclie***

- please write a write-up or blog about what you learnt in this 100 day also include what knowledge you had then and after the challenge what knowledge you have. what things you learn and what challenges you face
 
   ***Working on writting my first blog, mostly with in days it will be published.Here the blog [AnugrahSR](http://anugrahsr.me/)***

- How you were introduced to bug bounties bro? (Where did u hear about bug bounty at first time) and what was your first thought that came to mind after hearing so..
 
  ***Introduction to bugbounty, saw people posting intel acknowledgment, sony t-shirts, mugs, hof in 2017. Followed bunch of people's in tweeter, asked a few and no one really helped that time. In lockdown I saw the people I follow back then posting videos, tutorials, write ups***
