- How much time you take to study the target and how much to hunt in general ? And how much time for studying the  infosec things ?
 
   ***I usually take programs with wildcard domains or all in scope.  so it was more or less following bughunters methodology by jhadix. times are usally 1-2hr reading blogs, 1-2hr poc videos daily and labs occactionly weekly 2 days hunting or when i feel so.  I never rushed tbh***


- What do you recommend to the fellow people who doing the challenge like the basics stuff , some might lose interest in doing what kept u doing the challenge how to keep doing these stuff 
 
   ***Never think this as a race, you are just jogging for fun. If you want to take a break do it, never force it on you. If you get intrested learning CTF or forensic go for it. I also lost interest, but keep making friends in community, talk to them, read blogs that will bring you up***

    ***More than i thought, aug was one among them, didn't do anything than watch youtube videos and tutorials. Rest of the times I was able to get back within weeks of time.
  Having people around you to talk to is great, writting bash scripts was my way to overcome***

- Have you ever stuck in a situation , in which you want to bruteforce a admin panel, and let's say you have a username, so what wordlist you will use to bruteforce the admin panel ?
 
   ***I haven't done that rather than spraying admin:admin or admin: password such generic things. If you are talking about username enumeration there are lost with top 1M words or something.***


- Focusing on one bug class is better than noob at all which one is ur. Now a days technical bug is very difficult to find.On which bug we have to focus more.Collecting reports & poc of one critical bug and understand them in depth will help u or not
 
   ***I have focused on multiple bugs because, all those was p4 P3 kinda things, easy to understand not that much of technical. Still many advice to take one bug and be good at that. I started focusing on subdomin takeoveover, eventually turned into recon***

- Getting duplicates bug of only p4 bug
What should I have to do please guide me
 
  ***You can do 3 things 1. Be the first one to report. 2. Be the first one to go to untouched areas. 3. Levelup your game with increasing your bug type pool. Learn a new bug type or functionality abuse.
  Moreover dups only mean you're slow, next time be faster. It's a valid bug***
