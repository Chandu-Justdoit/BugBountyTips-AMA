# Burnouts ðŸ”¥

- During your 100 days of improvement how many burnout you faces !
 
    ***More than i thought, aug was one among them, didn't do anything than watch youtube videos and tutorials. Rest of the times I was able to get back within weeks of time.
    Having people around you to talk to is great, writting bash scripts was my way to overcome***
