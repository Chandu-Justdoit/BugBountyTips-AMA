- Any suggestion for SQL injection? How I approach for this vulnerability
Thank you 

  ***I am not into common findings but this one will help you https://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-04/bh-us-04-hotchkies/bh-us-04-hotchkies.pdf
 There are many resources but I prefer http://securityidiots.com/Web-Pentest/SQL-Injection***

- in main application you actively look for ways to abuse particular functionality right?
 
   ***Yes . Mostly feedback form for blind os injection***

- How you look for Information disclosure on OTX or or how you can test OS injection on feedback form or somewhere else.
  
   ***Instead of otx u can use wayback, I use multiple for more results and there is lab on os    injection in port swigger , cmdi pdf of blackhat also available***
