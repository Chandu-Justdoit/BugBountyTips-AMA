# Tips for Recon üîç
 
- If you dont do much recon kindly let us know your methodology ? how do you approach a target ? Any checklists you follow ?

   ***I'm always checking for logical bugs, going through the application, and thinking of what shouldn't happen and go further testing. I'm not doing a checklist at first, I make a goal.. let's say I want to find Blind XSS. I'm going to find every endpoint which goes on an admin panel***

- Can you elaborate your recon methodology/tools ?
 
     ***I don't really do too much recon nowadays.There are too many resources on recon and everybody does this now.The most important thing is to know the application and read the docs. Also collecting interesting endpoints and fuzzing them resulted in some nice idors.***
