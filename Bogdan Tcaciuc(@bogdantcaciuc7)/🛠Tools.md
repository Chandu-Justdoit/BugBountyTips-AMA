# Tools ðŸ› 

- Which are some of the awesome tools you use ?

  ***I use the well known ones, aquatone & amass & combination between ffuf and dirsearch.***

- Can you elaborate your recon methodology/tools ?
 
  ***I don't really do too much recon nowadays.
 There are too many resources on recon and everybody does this now.
 The most important thing is to know the application and read the docs. Also collecting interesting endpoints and fuzzing them resulted in some nice idors.***
