 Quote from similar question.***

- What is the present method of studying do you recommend to the beginners ( like sites, people, topics,etc)

  ***The present method is practice.Practice every little thing you learned on VDP programs.
Didn't do CTF's but I saw a lot of people who learned that way.***

- Do you think Bug Bounty will be extinct in a few years?
 
  ***No way.
  It will be bigger.***

- There are many factors which you can't deny about my fear. Such as
*Implementation of modern technologies like AI, ML, NL on appsec
*Overcrowd of experienced researchers
*Crowdsourced and AI-powered security platforms like 
@detectify
 will reduce the attack surface a lot

    ***We canâ€™t talk too much about the future but I believe that it will be vulnerabilities for everyone.There's a risk of being flop if someone is starting now. And the reasons are mentioned above. Even you couldnâ€™t refute my logics. Also you are unable to predict a positive future of it. You guys have already achieved a lot so tension for you, only beginners like us will suffer
 If you think like that you shouldn't do this.
 I put a lot of effort and take a risk doing this and it turned out very good.
 There are a lot of examples of new successful people coming in.
 If you think too much and don't do something you will achieve nothing.
 Good luck!***
