- While learning a bugs what is your approach and methodology..?

    ***Learning the technologies in deep in terms of that type of bug is the key.***

   ***I just proxy applications and analyze the http requests/responses on the back-end :)***

- Any Tips for beginners..?

  ***Do not focus to find only a few bugs (such as XSS, SQLi etc.) but focus to understand the technologies at first and try to understand the application flows from both the attacker/company sides. E.g. how an attacker can misuse this app & how the business could be affected.***

- How do you manage learning time and hunting time Example like 4 days reading ( to stay up to date), 3 days hunting
 
  ***1 hour reading twitter/blogs every day after I wake up & before starting working on weekdays. Prefer splitting into all days rather than having "learning days".***

- How much time did it take you to find once you started?

    ***Found it in a week after started full time hunting.
     Over-working really kills your both physical/mental life and on my first consultancy job we were really over-working so I can suggest that finding balance between your social life/hobbies and work is really important.***

- How long it took you to reach where you are standing now since you started and what difficulties you faced during your learning days and hunting days .
 
   ***Started offensive security area 7 years ago within in addition to 5 year bachelors focused on information systems. Worked really hard especially for the first year started my career (Maybe 10-12 hours per day, but with joy) and for the first a few months started full time hunting***

- any advice for finding bugs on small  single scope domain ?
 
   ***No difference than a huge scope in my opinion. Just try to understand the logic and flow of the app and try to brake it with attackers perspective.***

- Do you face any difficulty or demotivation in the beginning of your journey ? How do you deal with that ?
 
    ***Having goals keeps people motivated all the time, not just for bug bounty or work but for life. Have some both compelling and reachable goals for your life and you will find motivation on yourself!***

- what books have you read that make you better at web hacking?
  
  ***I read "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook" when I first started my career - still one of the best books on the market - and not read any information security related books afterwards.***
