# Note Keeping ðŸ“’

- How do you keep your notes and progress when hunting, do you trust online services to keep your private notes?
For example, do you trust Dropbox when to save sensitive progress when you hack Dropbox?
  
  ***I use sublime to keep my notes. There is a limit to which you can avoid online services. Most of the big companies also get hacked that doesn't mean they are not secure but when it comes to my private data, I always try not to use online services.***
