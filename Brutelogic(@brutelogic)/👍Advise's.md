# Advice's üëç

- predictions for the long term future? where do you think new vulnerability classes will come from? what do you think web app security will look like in 10 years?

  ***I would bet in JavaScript stuff since things are moving more and more from server to client side.So client side vulnerabilities might become more and more important. Mobile is also obviously an import battlefield to keep an eye on. Hard to tell anything for 10 years from now.***

- Where you see bb in coming years?
  
  ***Hard to predict. I think it will depend heavily on REGULATORY LAW if any to come. By now, it will stop growing and it will reach an equilibrium soon. World is changing too so it might affect how new #hacking generations will behave but I bet in power back to Community.***

- There are so many youngsters give their heart and soul for hacking .Aiming to get a career in #infosec .What will be ur advise to them ? Do you think they are right in choosing this path ?

  ***i use to say in private chats to all those who get too anxious for results or are actually frustrated with their actual performance and/or level of understanding: 
achievement = time + effort.So keep going, don't give up, be patient. Good things take time to happen.***

- what life means to you me -  i hate my life, god don't want anyone to stay with me. totally distracted not doing anything, not able to do bug hunting, i want to do but i can't

   ***Sure, why not? Do some independent work in the field, contribute to community, do some social networking, get some certifications, send resumes, look for job offers and apply to them, try to give some talks, etc. So many possibilities, dedicate yourself to it and it will happen.***
