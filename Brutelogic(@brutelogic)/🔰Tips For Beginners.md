# Tips For Beginners ðŸ”°

- Guideline to hunt XSS on mobile applications
  
  ***Mobile uses the same HTTP protocol and HTML/JS stack web sites do. Usually they just open an instance of WebView or something to do that which is pretty much like dealing     with any major browser. So fundamentally it's the same test methodology.***


- How much time he taken to go that level.. and how can we learn more about xss
 
  ***It takes a lot of time but it depends on your efforts and availability. I'm still learning after 5 years dedicated almost exclusively to it. One can always learn more about   #XSS by practicing and becoming a researcher him/herself in that field.***


- See, if someone asks me that he/she wants to learn XSS, 
@brutelogic's site is the first one I recommend...
Question :
How will your methodology go step by step in finding Xss in websites right from the recon phase? It's one of the many questions that newbies have in their minds

   ***I have a blog post about it. It's exactly the same methodology I've applied to  @knoxss_me because I've tried to reproduce my thought process when approaching a target    page. It gets improved constantly though.

- To understand xss attack completely what should I know before. From where to start about xss boss beginner

- Tell me your best secret: How to be that awesome person?
  Thanks in advance!
   
    ***I just try to CARE about things, people, animals, etc. I know world is not like that but if a simple rule of "doing for the others what you do expect to be done for you"   could be followed by most people, there would be no awesome person, just regular ones. Thank you, my friend!***


- What are the types of bugs that a beginner, with little technical knowledge, should learn first? Thanks sir!
 
   ***Beginners with little technical knowledge should not learn about bugs at all. You should learn first how to use your computer, operating systems (Linux, Unix-like etc),      network and specially PROGRAMMING. You can't expect to learn about advanced topics lacking basic knowledge.***


- Done that for more than a year now, but how do i know when I'm ready to start finding bugs?what platform do you suggest practicing on?
   
   ***Just started to look for it and see how it goes. The problem is not your ability to find bugs but in which environment you will look for it: if you do it on BBPs it will be harder and you will probably think you are not ready so do it elsewhere first.A platform called WORLD WIDE WEB.***
