# Tips for Xss üîç

- How u find Vulnerable parameters for XSS

  ***They are usually there, you just need to test them properly for reflection and also reading some HTML and JS code.***

- What was your biggest breakdown, and what would you suggest to overcome these things?
 
   ***We all pass for these moments from time to time and it's hard to point just 1. What I suggest is to try to find strength in your family, friends, 
    community (on/offline) and whatever good things you have. Cause you have to keep it running, so the sooner you stand up, the better.***

- How do you find xss when the scope is everything would you rather do manually or any toll ( if so which one)
 
   ***In that case I would probably start manually to sort the best entry points to try with a tool. And using manually again to exploit if there's a good information from the tool when it can't proceed properly***

- What is the most unexpected place where you found an xss and what is the weirdest xss payload you ever saw/crafted?
  
  ***I think it was in Baidu website (Chinese Google), it was #4 in Alexa ranking at that time (2015). The weirdest payloads I see are always the latest ones I craft to bypass major #WAFs! Those who got to know them might agree with me I guess...***

- How common are DOM based xss these days ?  Is reading javascript form dom vulnerabilities worth in this time ?
   
   ***If you think about the whole web it's a number so small that wouldn't be worth to look for it, in scale. But it happens somewhat more frequently in big sites like the ones in BB programs due to their complexity and use of new technologies. Yes, sometimes reading JS pays off.***
