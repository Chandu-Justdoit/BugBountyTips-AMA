# Role Model ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Whom did you admire when you were at the learning stage? How long did it take to be where you are now? Thanks.

  ***In the learning stage of #HACKING it was guys like @hdmoore (all core Metasploit guys) @WeldPond
  @carnal0wnage & many others. When getting into #XSS it was guys like @RSnake @soaj1664ashar and the ones above me in XSSposed ranks. It took me 10 and 5yrs, respectively, til now!***
