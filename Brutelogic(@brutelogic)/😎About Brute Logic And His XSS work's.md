# About BruteLogic And His XSS work's ðŸ˜Ž

- How do you stay awesome?

  ***I think having great people and friends around me like you makes that possible! Thanks a lot!*** 

- How did you come up with the idea to focus on XSS, and master that?
 
  ***I was in need to really understand XSS since I've seen some researchers and challenges but I couldn't find basic information. So I've decided to apply my philosophy hack2learn to get good at it and challenged myself at XSSposed (now OBB) to get into 1 in their rankings***

- How do u get in with XSS
 
   ***While looking for different ways to make my payloads work, bypassing filters and specially WAFs.***

- What caught your attention for learning and researching on xss?
 
   ***It was some solution to a challenge using document.location.hash.slice with (1) and (2) to use chars filtered in the HTML payload. I've realized I had too little knowledge in XSS so that triggered me to understand common methods and properties of JS objects.***
 
- What will be your next/advanced level XSS attack process.
  
   ***It started already, it's a repo for CSRF (and other) exploits via XSS using our brand new project X55.is. You can contribute here:https://github.com/BruteLogic/X55***

- what is your next project?

  ***To hack the planet! Via XSS. Winking face***


- @brutelogic
  Guruji U r great..

  ***Thanks, appreciate it!***

-  Just curious! Is there a story behind the name brute logic?
 
   ***Sure! At that time I was convinced that a simple horizontal dictionary attack against a big company was enough to get into it (it was the easiest way I found to get into the one I've worked for). So I wanted something like Brute Force but at the same time just Force was really not enough, it should be smart. So I've changed to LOGIC but I've started in Portuguese as "logica bruta". I've changed to Brute Logic and to English language 10 days after. It was also in line with that security guard which became my avatar.***

  hello. I only have one question regarding your amazing tool: do you update it constantly with every little xxs find/trick that you discover? Or did you stop working on the tool once you made it available? Thank you

  ***I'm always updating it in the following way:***
     ***1. New major releases, always announced and usually w/ new features, improvements and/or new detection cases;***
     ***2. New minor releases, not always announced, w/ bug fixes, minor improvements etc + hot fixes for actual XSS covered cases.***
     ***New tricks, research etc fall into one of these categories, depending on its purpose.***


- Tell us about the most hard xss you done fire
 
   ***I think it was the bypass on Google Chrome v57 and up, shown below. I remember how hard I was trying to get another bypass after last fix and how happy I got when finally found it.

- At what age did you started hacking and what were you doing before
  ***At age of 32 (2010) but I had some interest on it several times before but never really got into it. I was just an IT technician. I've learned programming back in 90's, really old stuff like Pascal, COBOL and Assembly.***
